## Overall Learning 

My time at SURE Trust was a turning point for me. Beyond mastering tools like Figma, I learned what it means to be a professional. I was mentored by industry veterans who taught me that UI/UX is about solving human problems with empathy and discipline. I came out of it not just with design skills, but with the confidence to collaborate in a team and the resilience to handle real-world pressure.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: LevelUp – Gamified Productivity App </h3>
<p>
LevelUp is a productivity app designed for working professionals who struggle with motivation and task consistency.
The goal was to combine task management with gamification using XP, levels, and progress tracking.
I designed the complete user flow from onboarding to task creation and progress monitoring.
AI-based task suggestions were introduced to help users plan smarter and stay consistent.
The design focuses on clarity, motivation, and long-term habit building.

<!-- Project 2 -->
<h3 id="project2">Project 2: LevelUp – Redesign Case Study </h3>
<p>
This project is a redesign of the LevelUp app based on usability gaps and design improvements.
I refined the information architecture, simplified the task flow, and improved visual hierarchy.

<h3 id="project3">Project 3: Nexus Home – Smart Home Control Interface </h3>
<p>
Nexus Home is a smart home control dashboard designed for managing multiple devices in one place.
The goal was to create a simple and intuitive interface for users of all age groups.
I designed key screens like device control, room-wise management, and automation settings.
Special focus was given to accessibility, clarity, and quick actions.
The interface prioritizes ease of use over technical complexity.

CityCrave is a food ordering platform designed for both customers and restaurant partners.
I designed separate flows for users and restaurant owners to meet their specific needs.
User-side focuses on browsing, ordering, tracking, and payments.
Restaurant-side includes order management, menu control, and order status updates.
The design ensures smooth communication between both sides with minimal friction.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**
**LST:**
LST at SURE Trust is about character, ethics, and mindset. Since the organization has roots in values-based education these sessions likely taught you:

Personality Branding: I didn't just learn to make a resume; I learned how to present "the best version of myself" to the world.

Lateral Thinking: In UI/UX, there is never just one solution. LST taught you how to think outside the box to solve user problems in ways others might miss.

The Spirit of Service: I learned that your work as a designer has a social impact. It’s not just about business; it’s about making life easier for people (especially rural or underserved users).

Resilience & Discipline: SURE Trust is known for being strict. LST helped you build the mental toughness to handle pressure, meet deadlines, and stay committed even when the work got hard.

**SST:**
If LST was about who I am, SST was about how I interact. For a UI/UX designer, these are the skills that get your designs approved:

The Art of Communication: I learned that being a great designer is useless if I can't explain my ideas. SST taught me how to speak clearly, listen actively, and present my prototypes with confidence.

Mock Interviews & Grooming: I likely practiced how to handle tough questions and how to dress and behave in a professional setting.

Feedback Management: In UI/UX, "critique" is part of the job. SST taught me how to take constructive criticism without taking it personally—using it to improve your design instead.

Networking: I learned how to connect with mentors from big companies and how to build a professional network that lasts beyond the internship.

## **Community Services**

<!-- add descreption in your own words -->

During my internship period, I participated in multiple community-oriented activities .....
What I Learned From Tree Plantation
When I was out there planting trees, it wasn't just about digging holes or putting seeds in the ground; it was a lesson in patience and responsibility.
The Feeling: I felt a deep sense of peace and connection to the Earth. It was humbling to realize that I was doing something today that would benefit people and the planet years after my internship ended. It gave me a break from the digital world and made me feel like I was truly "giving back."
The Lesson: I learned that real growth takes time and care. In UI/UX, I often want immediate results, but the trees taught me that you have to build a strong foundation first. It taught me Sustainability—both in nature and in my work. I now realize that as a designer, I have a responsibility to create things that last and contribute positively to the world.

What I Learned From Helping Elder Citizens
Spending time with elderly citizens was probably the most emotional part of my journey. It completely changed my perspective on what "User Experience" actually means.
The Feeling: I felt a huge wave of empathy and patience. Seeing them struggle with things that I find easy—like using a phone or navigating a physical space—made me feel protective. It made me realize how often society, and especially technology, leaves them behind.
The Lesson: This was my biggest lesson in Accessibility. Before this, "inclusive design" was just a chapter in a book for me. After helping them, it became a personal mission. I learned to look at my designs through their eyes—asking if the buttons are big enough, if the contrast is sharp enough, and if the language is simple enough. They taught me that if a design doesn't work for everyone, it’s a broken design.
